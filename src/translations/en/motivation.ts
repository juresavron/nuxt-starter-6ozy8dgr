  solutionTitle: 'Our Compliant Solution',
  solutionText: 'Our system collects internal reviews first, then sends personalized follow-up messages encouraging Google reviews. This approach is fully compliant with Google\'s guidelines because rewards are given for internal feedback, not directly for Google reviews.',

  complianceText: 'Our system is designed to be 100% compliant with Google\'s terms of service. We never directly incentivize Google reviews, but instead reward customers for providing internal feedback. The follow-up messages encouraging Google reviews are sent separately and do not mention any rewards, ensuring full compliance with Google\'s guidelines.'
